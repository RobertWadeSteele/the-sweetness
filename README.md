# The Sweetness

## What is this?

A project to learn React and SSR with.

## How do I run this?

1. Clone the repository
1. Open two terminals in the projects root directory
    1. Run `npm install`
    1. Run `npm run watch` in the first terminal (builds and watches for changes)
    1. Run `npm run serve` in the second terminal (serves from the built server)

This setup will watch all files and recompile the client or server depending on which files change.

You can also run `npm run build` to build for a production environment.
